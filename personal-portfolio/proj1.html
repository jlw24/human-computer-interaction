			<p>This app allows users to maintain "bookshelves" of books that they want to read, are reading now, and that they've finished reading.<br>
			<br>
			This mockup supports all of the following 6 tasks:</p>
			<div class="task">
				<ul>
					<li>User searches for a favorite author or book title and adds a new book to their list of things to read.</li>
					<li>User notices a currently trending book and adds it to their list of things to read.</li>
					<li>User removes a book from the list of things they are currently reading because they didn't like the first chapter.</li>
					<li>User moves a book from the currently reading shelf to the finished reading shelf.</li>
					<li>User selects a book to start reading from their list of things to read.</li>
					<li>User rates a book that they just finished reading and writes a short review of the book. They want to strongly recommend it to others.</li>
				</ul>
